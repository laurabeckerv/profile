        <p>Ask me about:<br>Lots of good book recommendations,<br>and ups and downs of working in a startup<br><br>
        Iâ€™d like to learn about:<br>UI/UX design, and how to connect business and tech to build great products<br><br>
        For the past three years, I have worked in a startup in the education and healthcare industry. I started as the first employee there, and as the startup took off, I concentrated on building the Product and IT and learned how to establish processes, communication channels and build a team.<br><br>
        After leaving my current employer, I have two goals: First, experience first-hand what it means to do web development and discuss technical issues. Second, talk to a lot of fellow participants to get to know them and their experiences, and hopefully find a next job I'm excited about!</p>
